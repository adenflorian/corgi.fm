	- fixed in 735a86f03a9d07f1baf1d4801e7d649829f33e8b
- [ ] changing room thru selector doesn't completely pick up new user name if changed in previous room?
- [ ] midi keyboard input plays unintended notes on octave 8 (EliTheCoder)
- [ ] when hooking up reverb and changing filter to 0 it can cause a loud sound which triggers the master volume safety
- [ ] when ableton is open, shamu wont recognize midi keyboard
