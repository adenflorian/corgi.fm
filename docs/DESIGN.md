# Goals
- simple
	- don't want it to appear too scary for new users
- flexible
	- needs to be easy to change and add new things
- clear
	- tools should be intuitive so users can easily figure out how to use them and learn what they do
- deep
	- quick to learn, hard to master?
- progressive
	- features will gradually be introduced to the user

# Inspirations
- software
	- visual programming
- hardware
	- modular synthesis
	- groove boxes
		- teenage engineering OP-1
		- synthstrom deluge
